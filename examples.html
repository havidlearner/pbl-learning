		<p>Although projects are the primary vehicle for instruction in project-based learning, there are no commonly shared 
			criteria for what constitutes an acceptable project. Projects vary greatly in the depth of the questions explored, 
			the clarity of the learning goals, the content and structure of the activity, and guidance from the teacher. 
			The role of projects in the overall curriculum is also open to interpretation. Projects can guide the entire 
			curriculum (more common in charter or other alternative schools) or simply consist of a few hands-on activities. 
			They might be multidisciplinary (more likely in elementary schools) or single-subject (commonly science and math). 
			Some projects involve the whole class, while others are done in small groups or individually.</p>

		<p>When PBL is used with 21st century tools/skills, students are expected to use technology in meaningful ways to help 
			them investigate, collaborate, analyze, synthesize and present their learning. The term IPBL has also been used to 
			reflect a pedagogy where an emphasis on technology and/or an interdisciplinary approach has been included.</p>

		<p>An example of a school that utilizes a project-based learning curriculum is Think Global School. In each country 
			(THINK Global School) visits, students select an interdisciplinary, project-based learning module designed to help 
			them answer key questions about the world around them. These projects combine elements of global studies, the 
			sciences, and literature, among other courses. Projects from past years have included recreating Homer’s <i>The 
			Odyssey</i> by sailing across Greece and exploring the locations and concepts central to the epic poem, and while 
			in Kerala, India, students participated in a project-based learning module centered around blending their learning 
			and travels into a mock business venture. The interdisciplinary project was designed to enable students to engage 
			in the key areas of problem solving, decision making and communication — all framed by the demanding parameters of 
			a “Shark Tank” style competition.</p>

		<p>Another example of applied PBL is Muscatine High School, located in Muscatine, Iowa. The school started the G2 
			(Global Generation Exponential Learning) which consists of middle and high school “Schools within Schools” that 
			deliver the four core subject areas. At the high school level, activities may include making water purification 
			systems, investigating service learning, or creating new bus routes. At the middle school level, activities may 
			include researching trash statistics, documenting local history through interviews, or writing essays about a 
			community scavenger hunt. Classes are designed to help diverse students become college and career ready after high 
			school.</p>

		<p>According to Terry Heick on his blog, Teach Thought, there are three types of project-based learning. The first 
			is Challenge-Based Learning/Problem-Based Learning, the second is Place-Based Education, and the third is 
			Activity-Based learning. 
			<ul class="paragraph-list">
				<li><strong>Challenge-Based Learning</strong> is “an engaging multidisciplinary approach to teaching and 
			learning that encourages students to leverage the technology they use in their daily lives to solve real-world 
					problems through efforts in their homes, schools and communities.”</li>
				<li><strong>Place-based Education</strong> “immerses students in local heritage, cultures, landscapes, 
					opportunities and experiences; uses these as a foundation for the study of 
			language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects across the curriculum, and emphasizes 
					learning through participation in service projects for the local school and/or community.”</li>
				<li><strong>Activity-Based Learning</strong> takes a kind of constructivist approach, the idea being 
					students constructing their own meaning through hands-on 
					activities, often with manipulatives and opportunities to demonstrate their learning.</li>
			</ul></p>

		<p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding to start holistic PBL schools across the United States. 
			These organizations include:</p>

				<li><a href="http://www.edvisionsschools.org/custom/SplashPage.asp" target=_blank>EdVisions Schools</a></li>

		<p>Another example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manor_Independent_School_District" target=_blank>
			Manor New Technology High School</a>, a public high school that since opening in 2007 is a 100 
			percent project-based instruction school. Students average 60 projects a year across subjects. It is reported that 
			98 percent of seniors graduate, 100 percent of the graduates are accepted to college, and fifty-six percent of 
			them have been the first in their family to attend college.</p>

		<p>The European Union has also providing funding for project-based learning projects within the Lifelong Learning 
			Programme 2007–2013. For example, PopuLLar - Music and language learning, Moving toys in the classroom and 
			ARTinED - A new approach to education using the arts.</p>
		
		<p>As a private school provider, Nobel Education Network combines PBL with the International Baccalaureate 
			as a central pillar of their strategy.</p>
