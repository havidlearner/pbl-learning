		<p>PBL relies on learning groups. Student groups determine their projects, in so doing, they engage student voice by 
			encouraging students to take full responsibility for their learning. This is what makes PBL constructivist. 
			Students work together to accomplish specific goals.</p>

		<p>When students use technology as a tool to communicate with others, they take on an active role vs. a passive role 
			of transmitting the information by a teacher, a book, or broadcast. The student is constantly making choices on 
			how to obtain, display, or manipulate information. Technology makes it possible for students to think actively 
			about the choices they make and execute. Every student has the opportunity to get involved either individually or 
			as a group.</p>

		<p>Instructor role in Project Based Learning is that of a facilitator. They do not relinquish control of the classroom 
			or student learning but rather develop an atmosphere of shared responsibility. The Instructor must structure the 
			proposed question/issue so as to direct the student's learning toward content-based materials. The instructor must 
			regulate student success with intermittent, transitional goals to ensure student projects remain focused and 
			students have a deep understanding of the concepts being investigated. The students are held accountable to 
			these goals through ongoing feedback and assessments. The ongoing assessment and feedback are essential to ensure 
			the student stays within the scope of the driving question and the core standards the project is trying to unpack. 
			According to Andrew Miller of the Buck Institute of Education, formative assessments are used “in order to be 
			transparent to parents and students, you need to be able to track and monitor ongoing formative assessments, that 
			show work toward that standard.” The instructor uses these assessments to guide the inquiry process and ensure the 
			students have learned the required content. Once the project is finished, the instructor evaluates the finished 
			product and learning that it demonstrates.</p>

		<p>Student role is to ask questions, build knowledge, and determine a real-world solution to the issue/question 
			presented. Students must collaborate expanding their active listening skills and requiring them to engage in 
			intelligent focused communication. Therefore, allowing them to think rationally on how to solve problems. PBL 
			forces students to take ownership of their success.</p>
