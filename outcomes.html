			</figure>More important than learning science, students need to learn to work in a community, thereby taking on social 
			responsibilities. The most significant contributions of PBL have been in schools languishing in poverty stricken 
			areas; when students take responsibility, or ownership, for their learning, their self-esteem soars. It also helps 
			to create better work habits and attitudes toward learning. In standardized tests, languishing schools have been 
			able to raise their testing grades a full level by implementing PBL.[citation needed] Although students do work 
			in groups, they also become more independent because they are receiving little instruction from the teacher. With 
			Project-Based Learning students also learn skills that are essential in higher education. The students learn more 
			than just finding answers, PBL allows them to expand their minds and think beyond what they normally would. 
			Students have to find answers to questions and combine them using critically thinking skills to come up with 
			answers.</p>

		<p>PBL is significant to the study of (mis-)conceptions; local concepts and childhood intuitions that are hard to 
			replace with conventional classroom lessons. In PBL, project science is the community culture; the student groups 
			themselves resolve their understandings of phenomena with their own knowledge building. Technology allows them to 
			search in more useful ways, along with getting more rapid results.</p>

		<p>Opponents of Project Based Learning warn against negative outcomes primarily in projects that become unfocused and 
			tangential arguing that underdeveloped lessons can result in the wasting of precious class time. No one teaching 
			method has been proven more effective than another. Opponents suggest that narratives and presentation of 
			anecdotal evidence included in lecture-style instruction can convey the same knowledge in less class time. Given 
			that disadvantaged students generally have fewer opportunities to learn academic content outside of school, wasted 
			class time due to an unfocused lesson presents a particular problem. Instructors can be deluded into thinking that 
			as long as a student is engaged and doing, they are learning. Ultimately it is cognitive activity that determines 
			the success of a lesson. If the project does not remain on task and content driven the student will not be 
			successful in learning the material. The lesson will be ineffective. A source of difficulty for teachers includes, 
			"Keeping these complex projects on track while attending to students' individual learning needs requires artful 
			teaching, as well as industrial-strength project management." Like any approach, Project Based Learning is only 
			beneficial when applied successfully.</p>

		<p>Problem-based learning is a similar pedagogic approach, however, problem-based approaches structure students' 
			activities more by asking them to solve specific (open-ended) problems rather than relying on students to come up 
			with their own problems in the course of completing a project.</p>

		<p>A meta-analysis conducted by Purdue University found that when implemented well, PBL can increase long-term 
			retention of material and replicable skill, as well as improve teachers' and students' attitudes towards learning.</p>
