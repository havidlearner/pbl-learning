		<p>A frequent criticism of PBL is that when students work in groups some will "slack off" or sit back and let the 
			others do all the work. Anne Shaw recommends that teachers always build into the structure of the PBL curriculum 
			an organizational strategy known as Jigsaw and Expert Groups. This structure forces students to be self-directed, 
			independent and to work interdependently.</p>

		<p>This means that the class is assigned (preferably randomly, by lottery) to Expert Groups. Each of the Expert Groups 
			is then assigned to deeply study one particular facet of the overall project. For example, a class studying about 
			environmental issues in their community may be divided into the following Expert Groups:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Air</li>
				<li>Land</li>
				<li>Water</li>
				<li>Human impact on the environment</li>
			</ol>

		<p>Each Expert Group is tasked with studying the materials for their group, taking notes, then preparing to teach 
			what they learned to the rest of the students in the class. To do so, the class will "jigsaw", thus creating 
			Jigsaw Groups. The Jigsaw Groups in the above example would each be composed of one representative from each of 
			the Expert Groups, so each Jigsaw Group would include:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>One expert on Air</li>
				<li>One expert on Land</li>
				<li>One expert on Water</li>
				<li>One expert on "Human impact on the environment"</li></ol>

			frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		
		<p>Each of these experts would then take turns teaching the others in the group. Total interdependence is assured. 
			No one can "slack off" because each student is the only person in the group with that "piece" of the information. 
			Another benefit is that the students must have learned the concepts, skills and information well enough to be able 
			to teach it and must be able to assess (not grade) their own learning and the learning of their peers. This forces
			 a much deeper learning experience.</p>

		<p>Anne Shaw recommends that when students are teaching each other they also participate collaboratively in creating a 
			concept map as they teach each other. This adds a significant dimension to the thinking and the learning. The 
			students may build upon this map each time they Jigsaw. If a project is scheduled to last over the time period of 
			six weeks the students may meet in their Expert Groups twice a week, and then Jigsaw twice a week, building upon 
			their learning and exploration of the topics over time.</p>

		<p>Once all the experts have taught each other, the Jigsaw Group then designs and creates a product to demonstrate 
			what they now know about all four aspects of the PBL unit - air, land, water, man's impact. Performance-based 
			products may include a wide range of possibilities such as dioramas, skits, plays, debates, student-produced 
			documentaries, web sites, Glogsters, VoiceThreads, games (digital or not), presentations to members of the 
			community (such as the City Council or a community organization), student-produced radio or television program, 
			a student-organized conference, a fair, a film festival.</p>

		<p>Students are assessed in two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Individual assessments for each student - may include research notes, teaching prep notes and teacher 
					observation. Other assessments may include those assigned by the teacher, for example, each student in the 
					class must write an individual research paper for a topic of their choice from within the theme of the 
					overall PBL.</li>

				<li>Group assessments - each Jigsaw group creates and presents their product, preferably to an audience other 
					than the teacher or their class.</li>
			</ol>
			
	<h2>Criticism</h2>
	
		<p>One concern is that PBL may be inappropriate in mathematics, the reason being that mathematics is primarily skill-
			based at the elementary level. Transforming the curriculum into an over-reaching project or series of projects 
			does not allow for necessary practice of particular mathematical skills. For instance, factoring quadratic 
			expressions in elementary algebra requires extensive repetition.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, a teacher could integrate a PBL approach into the standard curriculum, helping the students see 
			some broader contexts where abstract quadratic equations may apply. For example, Newton's law implies that tossed 
			objects follow a parabolic path, and the roots of the corresponding equation correspond to the starting and ending 
			locations of the object.</p>

		<p>Another criticism of PBL is that measures that are stated as reasons for its success are not measurable using 
			standard measurement tools, and rely on subjective rubrics for assessing results.</p>

		<p>In PBL there is also a certain tendency for the creation of the final product of the project to become the driving 
			force in classroom activities. When this happens, the project can lose its content focus and be ineffective in 
			helping students learn certain concepts and skills. For example, academic projects that culminate in an artistic 
			display or exhibit may place more emphasis on the artistic processes involved in creating the display than on the 
			academic content that the project is meant to help students learn.</p>
