		<h1>PBL - Real World Learning</h1>
		<h2>An Introduction to Project Based Learning</h2>
		<p>Project-based learning (PBL) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student-centred_learning" target=_blank>
			student-centered</a> pedagogy that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which students
		 acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. Students learn about a 
		 subject by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to a complex question, challenge, or problem.
		  It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning. PBL contrasts with paper-based, rote memorization, or 
		  teacher-led instruction that simply presents established facts or portrays a smooth path to knowledge by instead 
		  posing questions, problems or scenarios.</p>

		<p>Thomas Markham (2011) describes project-based learning (PBL) thus: <blockquote>"PBL integrates knowing and doing. 
			Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum, but also apply what they know to solve authentic 
			problems and produce results that matter. PBL students take advantage of digital tools to produce high quality, 
			collaborative products. PBL refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum--a shift mandated by the global 
			world, which rewards intangible assets such as drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and resiliency. 
			These cannot be taught out of a textbook, but must be activated through experience."</blockquote></p>
			
		<p>James G. Greeno (2006) has associated project-based learning with the "situated learning" perspective and with the 
			constructivist theories of Jean Piaget. Blumenfeld et al. elaborate on the processes of PBL: <blockquote>
			"Project-based learning is a comprehensive perspective focused on teaching by engaging students in investigation. 
			Within this framework, students pursue solutions to nontrivial problems by asking and refining questions, debating 
			ideas, making predictions, designing plans and/or experiments, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, 
			communicating their ideas and findings to others, asking new questions, and creating artifacts."</blockquote>
			<cite>(Blumenfeld, et al., 1991)</cite> The basis of PBL lies in the authenticity or real-life application 
			of the research. Students working as a team are given a "driving question" to respond to or answer, then directed 
			to create an artifact (or artifacts) to present their gained knowledge. Artifacts may include a variety of media 
			such as writings, art, drawings, three-dimensional representations, videos, photography, or technology-based 
			presentations.</p>

		<p>Proponents of project-based learning cite numerous benefits to the implementation of its strategies in the classroom - 
			including a greater depth of understanding of concepts, broader knowledge base, improved communication and 
			interpersonal/social skills, enhanced leadership skills, increased creativity, and improved writing skills. 
			Another definition of project-based learning includes a type of instruction, where students work together to solve 
			real-world problems in their schools and communities. Successful problem-solving often requires students to draw on 
			lessons from several disciplines and apply them in a very practical way. The promise of seeing a very real impact 
			becomes the motivation for learning.</p>

			John Dewey initially promoted the idea of "learning by doing". In <cite>My Pedagogical Creed (1897)</cite> Dewey enumerated his 
			beliefs regarding education: <blockquote>"The teacher is not in the school to impose certain ideas or to form 
			certain habits in the child, but is there as a member of the community to select the influences which shall 
			affect the child and to assist him in properly responding to these.......I believe, therefore, in the 
			so-called expressive or constructive activities as the centre of correlation." </blockquote><cite>(Dewey, 1897)</cite>
			Educational research has advanced this idea of teaching and learning into a methodology known as 
			"project-based learning". Blumenfeld &amp; Krajcik (2006) cite studies by Marx et al., 2004, Rivet &amp; Krajcki, 2004 
			and William &amp; Linn, 2003 state that "research has demonstrated that students in project-based learning classrooms get 
			higher scores than students in traditional classroom".</p>

		<p>In <cite>Peer Evaluation in Blended Team Project-Based Learning: What Do Students Find Important?, 
			Hye-Jung &amp; Cheolil (2012)</cite> describe "social loafing" as a negative aspect of collaborative learning. 
			Social loafing may include insufficient performances by some team members as well as a lowering of expected 
			standards of performance by the group as a whole to maintain congeniality amongst members. These authors said that 
			because teachers tend to grade the finished product only, the social dynamics of the assignment may escape the 
			teacher's notice.</p>


	<h2>Structure</h2>
	
		<p>Project-based learning emphasizes learning activities that are long-term, interdisciplinary and student-centered. 
		Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom activities, students often must organize their own work and manage their own 
		time in a project-based class. Project-based instruction differs from traditional inquiry by its emphasis on students' 
		collaborative or individual artifact construction to represent what is being learned.</p>

		<p>Project-based learning also gives students the opportunity to explore problems and challenges that have real-world 
			applications, increasing the possibility of long-term retention of skills and concepts.</p>

	<h2>Elements</h2>
	
		<p>The core idea of project-based learning is that real-world problems capture students' interest and provoke serious 
			thinking as the students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem-solving context. The teacher plays the role 
			of facilitator, working with students to frame worthwhile questions, structuring meaningful tasks, coaching both 
			knowledge development and social skills, and carefully assessing what students have learned from the experience. 
			Typical projects present a problem to solve (What is the best way to reduce the pollution in the schoolyard pond?) 
			or a phenomenon to investigate (What causes rain?).</p>

		<p>Comprehensive Project-based Learning:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>is organized around an open-ended driving question or challenge.</li>
			<li>creates a need to know essential content and skills.</li>
			<li>requires inquiry to learn and/or create something new.</li>
			<li>requires critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication, often known as
				 "21st Century Skills."</li>
			<li>allows some degree of student voice and choice.</li>
			<li>incorporates feedback and revision.</li>
			<li>results in a publicly presented product or performance.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	
		<p>Although projects are the primary vehicle for instruction in project-based learning, there are no commonly shared 
			criteria for what constitutes an acceptable project. Projects vary greatly in the depth of the questions explored, 
			the clarity of the learning goals, the content and structure of the activity, and guidance from the teacher. 
			The role of projects in the overall curriculum is also open to interpretation. Projects can guide the entire 
			curriculum (more common in charter or other alternative schools) or simply consist of a few hands-on activities. 
			They might be multidisciplinary (more likely in elementary schools) or single-subject (commonly science and math). 
			Some projects involve the whole class, while others are done in small groups or individually.</p>

		<p>When PBL is used with 21st century tools/skills, students are expected to use technology in meaningful ways to help 
			them investigate, collaborate, analyze, synthesize and present their learning. The term IPBL has also been used to 
			reflect a pedagogy where an emphasis on technology and/or an interdisciplinary approach has been included.</p>

		<p>An example of a school that utilizes a project-based learning curriculum is Think Global School. In each country 
			(THINK Global School) visits, students select an interdisciplinary, project-based learning module designed to help 
			them answer key questions about the world around them. These projects combine elements of global studies, the 
			sciences, and literature, among other courses. Projects from past years have included recreating Homer’s <i>The 
			Odyssey</i> by sailing across Greece and exploring the locations and concepts central to the epic poem, and while 
			in Kerala, India, students participated in a project-based learning module centered around blending their learning 
			and travels into a mock business venture. The interdisciplinary project was designed to enable students to engage 
			in the key areas of problem solving, decision making and communication — all framed by the demanding parameters of 
			a “Shark Tank” style competition.</p>

		<p>Another example of applied PBL is Muscatine High School, located in Muscatine, Iowa. The school started the G2 
			(Global Generation Exponential Learning) which consists of middle and high school “Schools within Schools” that 
			deliver the four core subject areas. At the high school level, activities may include making water purification 
			systems, investigating service learning, or creating new bus routes. At the middle school level, activities may 
			include researching trash statistics, documenting local history through interviews, or writing essays about a 
			community scavenger hunt. Classes are designed to help diverse students become college and career ready after high 
			school.</p>

		<p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding to start holistic PBL schools across the United States. 
			These organizations include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.bigpicture.org/" target=_blank>Big Picture Schools</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.edvisionsschools.org/custom/SplashPage.asp" target=_blank>EdVisions Schools</a></li>

				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raisbeck_Aviation_High_School" target=_blank>Raisbeck Aviation High School</a></li>
			</ul>

		<p>Another example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manor_Independent_School_District" target=_blank>
			Manor New Technology High School</a>, a public high school that since opening in 2007 is a 100 
			percent project-based instruction school. Students average 60 projects a year across subjects. It is reported that 
			98 percent of seniors graduate, 100 percent of the graduates are accepted to college, and fifty-six percent of 
			them have been the first in their family to attend college.</p>

		<p>The European Union has also providing funding for project-based learning projects within the Lifelong Learning 
			Programme 2007–2013. For example, PopuLLar - Music and language learning, Moving toys in the classroom and 
			ARTinED - A new approach to education using the arts.</p>

		<p>According to Terry Heick on his blog, Teach Thought, there are three types of project-based learning. The first 
			is Challenge-Based Learning/Problem-Based Learning, the second is Place-Based Education, and the third is 
			Activity-Based learning. Challenge-Based Learning is “an engaging multidisciplinary approach to teaching and 
			learning that encourages students to leverage the technology they use in their daily lives to solve real-world 
			problems through efforts in their homes, schools and communities.” Place-based Education “immerses students in 
			local heritage, cultures, landscapes, opportunities and experiences; uses these as a foundation for the study of 
			language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects across the curriculum, and emphasizes 
			learning through participation in service projects for the local school and/or community.” Activity-Based Learning 
			takes a kind of constructivist approach, the idea being students constructing their own meaning through hands-on 
			activities, often with manipulatives and opportunities to. As a private school provider, Nobel Education Network 
			combines PBL with the International Baccalaureate as a central pillar of their strategy.</p>

	<h2>Roles</h2>
	
		<p>PBL relies on learning groups. Student groups determine their projects, in so doing, they engage student voice by 
			encouraging students to take full responsibility for their learning. This is what makes PBL constructivist. 
			Students work together to accomplish specific goals.</p>

		<p>When students use technology as a tool to communicate with others, they take on an active role vs. a passive role 
			of transmitting the information by a teacher, a book, or broadcast. The student is constantly making choices on 
			how to obtain, display, or manipulate information. Technology makes it possible for students to think actively 
			about the choices they make and execute. Every student has the opportunity to get involved either individually or 
			as a group.</p>

		<p>Instructor role in Project Based Learning is that of a facilitator. They do not relinquish control of the classroom 
			or student learning but rather develop an atmosphere of shared responsibility. The Instructor must structure the 
			proposed question/issue so as to direct the student's learning toward content-based materials. The instructor must 
			regulate student success with intermittent, transitional goals to ensure student projects remain focused and 
			students have a deep understanding of the concepts being investigated. The students are held accountable to 
			these goals through ongoing feedback and assessments. The ongoing assessment and feedback are essential to ensure 
			the student stays within the scope of the driving question and the core standards the project is trying to unpack. 
			According to Andrew Miller of the Buck Institute of Education, formative assessments are used “in order to be 
			transparent to parents and students, you need to be able to track and monitor ongoing formative assessments, that 
			show work toward that standard.” The instructor uses these assessments to guide the inquiry process and ensure the 
			students have learned the required content. Once the project is finished, the instructor evaluates the finished 
			product and learning that it demonstrates.</p>

		<p>Student role is to ask questions, build knowledge, and determine a real-world solution to the issue/question 
			presented. Students must collaborate expanding their active listening skills and requiring them to engage in 
			intelligent focused communication. Therefore, allowing them to think rationally on how to solve problems. PBL 
			forces students to take ownership of their success.</p>

	<h2>Outcomes</h2>
	
		<p>More important than learning science, students need to learn to work in a community, thereby taking on social 
			responsibilities. The most significant contributions of PBL have been in schools languishing in poverty stricken 
			areas; when students take responsibility, or ownership, for their learning, their self-esteem soars. It also helps 
			to create better work habits and attitudes toward learning. In standardized tests, languishing schools have been 
			able to raise their testing grades a full level by implementing PBL.[citation needed] Although students do work 
			in groups, they also become more independent because they are receiving little instruction from the teacher. With 
			Project-Based Learning students also learn skills that are essential in higher education. The students learn more 
			than just finding answers, PBL allows them to expand their minds and think beyond what they normally would. 
			Students have to find answers to questions and combine them using critically thinking skills to come up with 
			answers.</p>

		<p>PBL is significant to the study of (mis-)conceptions; local concepts and childhood intuitions that are hard to 
			replace with conventional classroom lessons. In PBL, project science is the community culture; the student groups 
			themselves resolve their understandings of phenomena with their own knowledge building. Technology allows them to 
			search in more useful ways, along with getting more rapid results.</p>

		<p>Opponents of Project Based Learning warn against negative outcomes primarily in projects that become unfocused and 
			tangential arguing that underdeveloped lessons can result in the wasting of precious class time. No one teaching 
			method has been proven more effective than another. Opponents suggest that narratives and presentation of 
			anecdotal evidence included in lecture-style instruction can convey the same knowledge in less class time. Given 
			that disadvantaged students generally have fewer opportunities to learn academic content outside of school, wasted 
			class time due to an unfocused lesson presents a particular problem. Instructors can be deluded into thinking that 
			as long as a student is engaged and doing, they are learning. Ultimately it is cognitive activity that determines 
			the success of a lesson. If the project does not remain on task and content driven the student will not be 
			successful in learning the material. The lesson will be ineffective. A source of difficulty for teachers includes, 
			"Keeping these complex projects on track while attending to students' individual learning needs requires artful 
			teaching, as well as industrial-strength project management." Like any approach, Project Based Learning is only 
			beneficial when applied successfully.</p>

		<p>Problem-based learning is a similar pedagogic approach, however, problem-based approaches structure students' 
			activities more by asking them to solve specific (open-ended) problems rather than relying on students to come up 
			with their own problems in the course of completing a project.</p>

		<p>A meta-analysis conducted by Purdue University found that when implemented well, PBL can increase long-term 
			retention of material and replicable skill, as well as improve teachers' and students' attitudes towards learning.</p>

	<h2>Overcoming Obstacles and Criticisms</h2>
	
		<p>A frequent criticism of PBL is that when students work in groups some will "slack off" or sit back and let the 
			others do all the work. Anne Shaw recommends that teachers always build into the structure of the PBL curriculum 
			an organizational strategy known as Jigsaw and Expert Groups. This structure forces students to be self-directed, 
			independent and to work interdependently.</p>

		<p>This means that the class is assigned (preferably randomly, by lottery) to Expert Groups. Each of the Expert Groups 
			is then assigned to deeply study one particular facet of the overall project. For example, a class studying about 
			environmental issues in their community may be divided into the following Expert Groups:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Air</li>
				<li>Land</li>
				<li>Water</li>
				<li>Human impact on the environment</li>
			</ol>

		<p>Each Expert Group is tasked with studying the materials for their group, taking notes, then preparing to teach 
			what they learned to the rest of the students in the class. To do so, the class will "jigsaw", thus creating 
			Jigsaw Groups. The Jigsaw Groups in the above example would each be composed of one representative from each of 
			the Expert Groups, so each Jigsaw Group would include:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>One expert on Air</li>
				<li>One expert on Land</li>
				<li>One expert on Water</li>
				<li>One expert on "Human impact on the environment"</li>
			</ol>

		<p>Each of these experts would then take turns teaching the others in the group. Total interdependence is assured. 
			No one can "slack off" because each student is the only person in the group with that "piece" of the information. 
			Another benefit is that the students must have learned the concepts, skills and information well enough to be able 
			to teach it and must be able to assess (not grade) their own learning and the learning of their peers. This forces
			 a much deeper learning experience.</p>

		<p>Anne Shaw recommends that when students are teaching each other they also participate collaboratively in creating a 
			concept map as they teach each other. This adds a significant dimension to the thinking and the learning. The 
			students may build upon this map each time they Jigsaw. If a project is scheduled to last over the time period of 
			six weeks the students may meet in their Expert Groups twice a week, and then Jigsaw twice a week, building upon 
			their learning and exploration of the topics over time.</p>

		<p>Once all the experts have taught each other, the Jigsaw Group then designs and creates a product to demonstrate 
			what they now know about all four aspects of the PBL unit - air, land, water, man's impact. Performance-based 
			products may include a wide range of possibilities such as dioramas, skits, plays, debates, student-produced 
			documentaries, web sites, Glogsters, VoiceThreads, games (digital or not), presentations to members of the 
			community (such as the City Council or a community organization), student-produced radio or television program, 
			a student-organized conference, a fair, a film festival.</p>

		<p>Students are assessed in two ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Individual assessments for each student - may include research notes, teaching prep notes and teacher 
					observation. Other assessments may include those assigned by the teacher, for example, each student in the 
					class must write an individual research paper for a topic of their choice from within the theme of the 
					overall PBL.</li>

				<li>Group assessments - each Jigsaw group creates and presents their product, preferably to an audience other 
					than the teacher or their class.</li>
			</ol>
			
	<h2>Criticism</h2>
	
		<p>One concern is that PBL may be inappropriate in mathematics, the reason being that mathematics is primarily skill-
			based at the elementary level. Transforming the curriculum into an over-reaching project or series of projects 
			does not allow for necessary practice of particular mathematical skills. For instance, factoring quadratic 
			expressions in elementary algebra requires extensive repetition.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, a teacher could integrate a PBL approach into the standard curriculum, helping the students see 
			some broader contexts where abstract quadratic equations may apply. For example, Newton's law implies that tossed 
			objects follow a parabolic path, and the roots of the corresponding equation correspond to the starting and ending 
			locations of the object.</p>

		<p>Another criticism of PBL is that measures that are stated as reasons for its success are not measurable using 
			standard measurement tools, and rely on subjective rubrics for assessing results.</p>

		<p>In PBL there is also a certain tendency for the creation of the final product of the project to become the driving 
			force in classroom activities. When this happens, the project can lose its content focus and be ineffective in 
			helping students learn certain concepts and skills. For example, academic projects that culminate in an artistic 
			display or exhibit may place more emphasis on the artistic processes involved in creating the display than on the 
			academic content that the project is meant to help students learn.</p>
