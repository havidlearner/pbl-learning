			</figure>Project-based learning (PBL) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student-centred_learning" target=_blank>
			student-centered</a> pedagogy that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which students
		 acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. Students learn about a 
		 subject by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to a complex question, challenge, or problem.
		  It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning. PBL contrasts with paper-based, rote memorization, or 
		  teacher-led instruction that simply presents established facts or portrays a smooth path to knowledge by instead 
		  posing questions, problems or scenarios.</p>

		<p>Thomas Markham (2011) describes project-based learning (PBL) thus: <blockquote>"PBL integrates knowing and doing. 
			Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum, but also apply what they know to solve authentic 
			problems and produce results that matter. PBL students take advantage of digital tools to produce high quality, 
			collaborative products. PBL refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum--a shift mandated by the global 
			world, which rewards intangible assets such as drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and resiliency. 
			These cannot be taught out of a textbook, but must be activated through experience."</blockquote></p>
			
		<p>James G. Greeno (2006) has associated project-based learning with the "situated learning" perspective and with the 
			constructivist theories of Jean Piaget. Blumenfeld et al. elaborate on the processes of PBL: <blockquote>
			"Project-based learning is a comprehensive perspective focused on teaching by engaging students in investigation. 
			Within this framework, students pursue solutions to nontrivial problems by asking and refining questions, debating 
			ideas, making predictions, designing plans and/or experiments, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, 
			communicating their ideas and findings to others, asking new questions, and creating artifacts."  
			<cite>(Blumenfeld, et al., 1991)</cite></blockquote>  The basis of PBL lies in the authenticity or real-life application 
			of the research. Students working as a team are given a "driving question" to respond to or answer, then directed 
			to create an artifact (or artifacts) to present their gained knowledge. Artifacts may include a variety of media 
			such as writings, art, drawings, three-dimensional representations, videos, photography, or technology-based 
			presentations.</p>

		<p>Proponents of project-based learning cite numerous benefits to the implementation of its strategies in the classroom - 
			including a greater depth of understanding of concepts, broader knowledge base, improved communication and 
			interpersonal/social skills, enhanced leadership skills, increased creativity, and improved writing skills. 
			Another definition of project-based learning includes a type of instruction, where students work together to solve 
			real-world problems in their schools and communities. Successful problem-solving often requires students to draw on 
			lessons from several disciplines and apply them in a very practical way. The promise of seeing a very real impact 
			becomes the motivation for learning.</p>

			John Dewey initially promoted the idea of "learning by doing". In <cite>My Pedagogical Creed (1897)</cite> Dewey enumerated his 
			beliefs regarding education: <blockquote>"The teacher is not in the school to impose certain ideas or to form 
			certain habits in the child, but is there as a member of the community to select the influences which shall 
			affect the child and to assist him in properly responding to these.......I believe, therefore, in the 
			so-called expressive or constructive activities as the centre of correlation." <cite>(Dewey, 1897)</cite></blockquote>
			Educational research has advanced this idea of teaching and learning into a methodology known as 
			"project-based learning". Blumenfeld &amp; Krajcik (2006) cite studies by Marx et al., 2004, Rivet &amp; Krajcki, 2004 
			and William &amp; Linn, 2003 state that "research has demonstrated that students in project-based learning classrooms get 
			higher scores than students in traditional classroom".</p>

		<p>In <cite>Peer Evaluation in Blended Team Project-Based Learning: What Do Students Find Important?</cite>, 
			Hye-Jung &amp; Cheolil (2012) describe "social loafing" as a negative aspect of collaborative learning. 
			Social loafing may include insufficient performances by some team members as well as a lowering of expected 
			standards of performance by the group as a whole to maintain congeniality amongst members. These authors said that 
			because teachers tend to grade the finished product only, the social dynamics of the assignment may escape the 
			teacher's notice.</p>
