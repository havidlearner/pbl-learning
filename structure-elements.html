		<p>Project-based learning emphasizes learning activities that are long-term, interdisciplinary and student-centered. 
		Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom activities, students often must organize their own work and manage their own 
		time in a project-based class. Project-based instruction differs from traditional inquiry by its emphasis on students' 
		collaborative or individual artifact construction to represent what is being learned.</p>

		<p>Project-based learning also gives students the opportunity to explore problems and challenges that have real-world 
			applications, increasing the possibility of long-term retention of skills and concepts.</p>

	<h2>Elements</h2>
	
		<p>The core idea of project-based learning is that real-world problems capture students' interest and provoke serious 
			thinking as the students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem-solving context. The teacher plays the role 
			of facilitator, working with students to frame worthwhile questions, structuring meaningful tasks, coaching both 
			knowledge development and social skills, and carefully assessing what students have learned from the experience. 
			Typical projects present a problem to solve (What is the best way to reduce the pollution in the schoolyard pond?) 
			or a phenomenon to investigate (What causes rain?).</p>

		<p>Comprehensive Project-based Learning:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>is organized around an open-ended driving question or challenge.</li>
			<li>creates a need to know essential content and skills.</li>
			<li>requires inquiry to learn and/or create something new.</li>
			<li>requires critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication, often known as
				 "21st Century Skills."</li>
			<li>allows some degree of student voice and choice.</li>
			<li>incorporates feedback and revision.</li>
			<li>results in a publicly presented product or performance.</li>
		</ul>
